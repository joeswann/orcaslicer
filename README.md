Overview
This repository provides tailored 3D printer configuration files optimized for speed and performance, designed for your Ender 3 equipped with a BTT SKR Mini E3 V3 controller, Creality Sprite Pro hotend, CR Touch auto-leveling sensor, and advanced hardware.

Hardware Specifications:
- Printer: Ender 3 with dual Z axes
- Controller: BTT SKR Mini E3 V3 running Klipper firmware
- Hotend: Creality Sprite Pro with a hardened steel nozzle
- Build Surface: PEI with CR Touch auto-leveling

Repository Layout:
• hints.cereal: Additional printer hints and configurations.
• .gitignore: Maintains repository hygiene by ignoring unnecessary files.
• default/filament/: Contains filament profiles, including Bender PLA.
• default/machine/: Machine configuration files for motion parameters and G-code settings.
• default/process/: Slicing process settings optimized for high-speed printing.

Performance & Tuning:
Optimised acceleration, jerk values, and travel speeds reduce print times without sacrificing print quality. Fine-tuned retraction, bridge settings, and initial layer adhesion further enhance performance.

Usage:
For Klipper: Import machine configurations from default/machine/.
For OrcaSlicer: Load filament and process profiles from default/filament/ and default/process/.
Apply changes gradually and test extensively with calibration prints.

Resources:
• Klipper Documentation
• OrcaSlicer GitHub Repository

Enjoy enhanced printing performance with these advanced configurations!
